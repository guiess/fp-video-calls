# Voice-Video Project

Goal: WebRTC group video calls with persistent room URLs, optional room password, and configurable video quality (720p/1080p) for Web + Android.

## Structure
- docs/: architecture and configuration
- server/: signaling server (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- web/: React + TypeScript client
- android/: Kotlin app with WebRTC SDK
- turn/: coturn STUN/TURN server configuration (to be added)

## TODO by Service

### Server (Signaling, Node.js)
- [x] Define signaling server requirements (docs/architecture.md)
- [x] Initialize project manifest and skeleton (server/package.json, index.js)
- [x] Create room logic:
  - [x] Endpoint: POST /room → returns { roomId, settings } (human-readable slug)
  - [x] Auto-create on first join if room does not exist
  - [x] In-memory room storage with settings (videoQuality, passwordEnabled, passwordHash, hint)
- [x] REST endpoints:
  - [x] GET /health
  - [x] GET /room/:roomId/meta → { settings, passwordEnabled, hint? }
- [x] Socket.IO events:
  - [x] join_room, leave_room
  - [x] offer, answer, ice_candidate
  - [x] toggle_video, toggle_audio (stub-ready)
- [x] Room password support:
  - [x] set_room_password (POST /room/:id/password), clear_room_password (DELETE /room/:id/password)
  - [x] Verification on join with hint and error codes
- [ ] Managers:
  - [ ] RoomManager (create/join/leave/getParticipants/isRoomFull/cleanupEmptyRooms)
  - [ ] UserManager (add/remove/getBySocket/updateMedia)
- [-] Redis integration for room/participant state (planned; currently in-memory)
- [ ] Logging, error handling, health checks hardening
- [ ] Dockerfile and systemd service for deployment
- [ ] Unit tests for room and auth flows

### Web Client (React + TypeScript)
- [x] Define web app structure (docs/architecture.md)
- [x] Local test client for create/join and quality select (web/test.html)
- [ ] Scaffold project (Vite + React + TS)
- [ ] Routing: / and /room/:roomId
- [ ] Create Room page (POST /room then navigate to /room/:roomId)
- [ ] Password prompt flow using /room/:roomId/meta
- [ ] Socket client: connect, join_room, signaling handlers
- [ ] WebRTC hooks/services: PeerConnection, offers/answers, ICE
- [ ] ICE config: STUN/TURN/TURNS with dynamic credentials
- [ ] VideoGrid, ParticipantVideo, LocalVideo, Controls
- [ ] Apply 720p/1080p settings and bitrate layers
- [ ] Screen sharing (web)
- [ ] Error states and UX polish
- [ ] Basic e2e test for create/join/leave and multi-participant

### Android App (Kotlin + Compose)
- [x] Define Android app structure (docs/architecture.md)
- [ ] Scaffold project
- [ ] Integrate WebRTC SDK and Socket.IO client
- [ ] Permissions: CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO
- [ ] Join flow:
  - [ ] Fetch /room/:roomId/meta; show password dialog if required
  - [ ] Support deep link to /room/{roomId}
- [ ] WebRTCClient: PeerConnectionFactory, capture, encodings
- [ ] Apply 720p/1080p settings and bitrate layers with HW H.264 preference
- [ ] Compose UI: grid, controls, lifecycle handling
- [ ] Interop tests with web client
- [ ] Background/reconnect behavior

### TURN/STUN (coturn)
- [x] Plan TURN/STUN setup (docs/architecture.md)
- [ ] Create turn/turnserver.conf with realm, external-ip, ports, TLS certs
- [ ] Enable use-auth-secret; implement HMAC credential generation on server
- [ ] Open NSG ports: 3478 UDP/TCP, 5349 TCP, 10000–20000 UDP
- [ ] Service enable/start, health monitoring and logs
- [ ] Validation across NAT types

### Azure Infrastructure & Ops
- [x] Document deployment strategy (docs/architecture.md)
- [x] **Azure App Service + Static Web Apps deployment guides** 📋
- [x] **Azure Key Vault integration for secrets management** 🔐
- [x] **Environment variables configuration** ⚙️
- [x] **CI/CD pipeline templates (GitHub Actions)** 🔄
- [x] **Monitoring setup (Application Insights)** 📊
- [x] **Automated deployment script** 🚀
- [ ] Custom domain and CDN setup
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Performance monitoring and scaling configuration

### Testing & Launch
- [x] Local 2-tab P2P test via web/test.html and signaling server
- [ ] Interop: Web ↔ Android across common browsers/devices/NATs
- [ ] Performance tuning for 5–10 participants at selected quality
- [ ] Staging test with real users
- [ ] Launch and monitor

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy to Azure

**Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download and run the automated deployment script
curl -o deploy-azure.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/voice-video/main/scripts/deploy-azure.sh
chmod +x deploy-azure.sh
./deploy-azure.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step**
Follow the comprehensive guide: [docs/azure-deploy-complete.md](docs/azure-deploy-complete.md)

**What gets deployed:**
- ✅ **Backend**: Node.js signaling server on Azure App Service
- ✅ **Frontend**: React app on Azure Static Web Apps
- ✅ **Security**: Azure Key Vault for TURN credentials (optional)
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Application Insights integration
- ✅ **CORS**: Properly configured cross-origin policies
- ✅ **WebSockets**: Enabled for real-time communication

**Connection Success Rates:**
- 🔄 **STUN-only (testing)**: 70-85% - Some users behind NAT/firewalls cannot connect
- 🎯 **STUN + TURN (production)**: 99%+ - Universal connectivity, requires paid TURN service

**Environment Variables Managed:**
- `VITE_SIGNALING_URL` - WebSocket server endpoint
- `VITE_TURN_*` - TURN server configuration for NAT traversal (optional)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Frontend domain allowlist

## Notes
- Start with 720p default; allow 1080p per room if bandwidth/device allows.
- Safari prefers H.264; Android benefits from HW H.264.
- Pure mesh scales to 5–10 users; for guaranteed multi-user 1080p, consider SFU later.
